'''
input:
    board:
        string type, empty spots are '0'
        comma delimited str of single/9digit ints?
        single large int?

    interactive solving:
        space or comma delimited? all? or (number coord1,coord2)
        or 3 seperate input calls? <-- this one call num, row, col
        number guessing:
            just a single int
        position:
            2 seperate ints

functions:
    convert board input into list of lists --> [[r1], [r2], ...[r9]]
    validate interactive cli game input
    row checker
    column checker
    box checker
    board checker
    replace func (prolly custom?) <-- look this up...
    print the solved board out

output:
    solved board
    no brackets
    spaces between numbers
    possibly add lines

next:
    implement with pygame for better visuals
    optimization!

'''
Dani suggestion/approval...
I think a sudoku game would be within scope for this intensive,
and the solver could be your bike or car, approved

    maually store all coordinates of the board in a dict where key is box number

    ^ Should that be hard coded in or algorithmically created at every startup?
    well if were only doing 9x9 it wouuld be fine to hard code it 
    but that looks atrocious... so uh thats what imma do for speed stuff....
    wait is it actually faster? 
    TODO: test the speeds and write the algo to create this dict
