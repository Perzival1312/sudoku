'''
input:
    board:
        string type, empty spots are '0'
        comma delimited str of single/9digit ints?
        single large int?

    interactive solving:
        space or comma delimited? all? or (number coord1,coord2)
        or 3 seperate input calls? <-- this one call num, row, col
        number guessing:
            just a single int
        position:
            2 seperate ints

functions:
    convert board input into list of lists --> [[r1], [r2], ...[r9]]
    validate interactive cli game input
    row checker
    column checker
    box checker
    board checker
    replace func (prolly custom?) <-- look this up...
    print the solved board out

output:
    solved board
    no brackets
    spaces between numbers
    possibly add lines

next:
    implement with pygame for better visuals
    optimization!

'''
Dani suggestion/approval...
I think a sudoku game would be within scope for this intensive,
and the solver could be your bike or car, approved
